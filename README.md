# Voting App â€“ DevOps Pipeline Tutorial

This is a simple fullstack web application built with Node.js/Express.js. It's designed to help students understand and implement a basic DevOps pipeline using **GitHub Actions** for Continuous Integration (CI) and manual deployment to **Render**.

## Step 1 â€“ Setup Project Locally

> **Recommended:** First, fork the repository to your own GitHub account so you have full control and ownership of your version.

```bash
# Fork the repo at https://github.com/alfhisa/devops-tut-lb07
# Then clone your forked version:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/devops-tut-lb07
cd devops-tut-lb07
npm install
npm start
```

> You should see the app when accessing `http://localhost:3000`  
> If the port is already in use, change it in `index.js` or terminate the existing process.

## Step 2 â€“ Setup GitHub Actions for CI

Click `Actions` then click `set up a workflow yourself`
Create a file at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
name: Node.js CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repo
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Run tests
      run: echo "No tests available"
```

Every push to the `main` branch will trigger the pipeline on GitHub Actions.

## Step 3 â€“ Manual Deployment to Render

1. Go to [https://render.com](https://render.com)
2. Click **New Web Service**
3. Connect your GitHub repo (`devops-tut-lb07`)
4. Select the `main` branch and configure:

   - **Build Command:** `npm install`
   - **Start Command:** `npm start`
   - **Environment:** `Node`

5. Click **Create Web Service**

Render will automatically redeploy your app when new changes are pushed to `main`.

---

## Step 4 â€“ CI/CD Flow Check

1. Commit & push changes to `main`
2. Visit GitHub â†’ **Actions** tab â†’ ensure CI pipeline passes
3. Check your app live on Render
